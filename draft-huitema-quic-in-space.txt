Abstract

   This document discusses the challenges of running the QUIC transport
   over deep space links, where delays are in order of minutes and
   communications are based on scheduled time windows.  Using the
   experience of various testbeds, it provides guidance to
   implementations to support this use case.  This document may apply to
   other use cases that have similar characteristics, such as IoT in
   disconnected and distant settings.

1.  Introduction

   QUIC is a new transport bringing very interesting features that could
   enable its use in space, where TCP is not good, as assessed in
   [DTN-ARCH].  However, QUIC was designed for terrestrial Internet,
   which brings assumptions on typical delays and connectivity.  In
   (deep) space, delays are much larger, in order of minutes (4-20
   minutes to Mars), and long disruptions, such as because of orbital
   dynamics, in order of minutes or hours or days.

   It may be possible to modify the base behavior of QUIC stacks to
   satisfy these requirements.  For example, several assumptions, such
   as initial RTT, are just static constants in the code that could be
   externalized so they could better start the QUIC machinery in the
   context of space.

   The purpose of this document is to provide guidance for supporting
   space communications in QUIC implementations.  It should be noted
   that it may also apply to other use cases that have similar
   characteristics, such as IoT in disconnected and far away settings,
   but these are not considered specifically in this document.

   Various other considerations such as how to store packets during
   disruptions or network management considerations are out of scope of
   this document.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Timer Constants in QUIC

   QUIC implementations typically use a number of time related
   variables, with different characteristics.  Some may be constants
   suggested by the QUIC specification or chosen by the stack
   developers, some may be negotiated between peers, and some may be
   discovered as part of running the protocol.  Preliminary tests showed
   that setting the constant values appropriately seemed to make QUIC
   usable in those deep space scenarios.  Therefore, this document
   discusses them in the following sections.

3.1.  Probe Timeout and Initial RTT (#initial-rtt)

   As defined in [QUIC-RECOVERY], QUIC uses two mechanisms to detect
   packet losses.  The acknowledgement based method detect losses if a
   packet is not yet acknowledged while packets sent later have already
   been.  That method works well even if the transmission delay is long,
   but cannot detect the loss of the "last packet".  For that, QUIC uses
   the probe timeout defined in Section 6.2 of [QUIC-RECOVERY].  If the
   last packet is not yet acknowledged after the probe timeout, the
   endpoint sends a "probe" to trigger an acknwledgement.  The probe
   timer is initially set as a function of the measured RTT and RTTVAR.
   It is then increased exponentially as the number of unacknowledged
   repetitions increases.

   The mechanism works well if the transmission delay is long after the
   RTT has been evaluated at least once.  But before that, the probe
   timeout is set as a function of the Initial RTT, whose recommended
   value is 333 milliseconds per Section 6.2.2 of [QUIC-RECOVERY].  Many
   implementations use smaller values because waiting too long results
   in longer connection delays when losses occur.  The recommended
   initial value of 333ms results in a PTO of 1 second, but the shorter
   values used by some implementations can result in a PTO of 200 or
   250ms.  On a long delay link, we will probably see the following:

   1.  Initial transmission

   2.  First repeat after timer (e.g. 1 second)

   3.  2nd repeat after timer (e.g., 1 second again), after which the
       timer is doubled

   4.  3rd repeat after the increased (e.g., 2 seconds), after which the
       timer is doubled again

   5.  etc.

   If we let the process go long enough, a succession of doubling will
   probably match the required value, probably after a dozen repeats if
   the delay is about 20 minutes.  In that case, one of the dozen
   repeats will most likely be successful, but of course a lot of extra
   energy will have been expanded.  But the connection establishment
   will fail if the process is interrupted too soon, either because the
   maximum number of repeats has been reached, or because the "idle
   timeouty" has been exceeded.

3.2.  Idle Timeout

   The idle timeout is defined in Section 10.1 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].
   Each peer proposes a "max_idle_timeout" value, and commits to close
   the connection if no activity happens during that timeout.  The
   "max_idle_timeout" value is often set as a constant by either the
   stack or the application using it, with typical values ranging from a
   few seconds to a few minutes.

   The specification anticipated the usage of long delay links somewhat,
   and states that "To avoid excessively small idle timeout periods,
   endpoints MUST increase the idle timeout period to be at least three
   times the current Probe Timeout (PTO)."  This will prevent
   interference between the idle timeout once the PTO has been properly
   assessed.  However, this proper assessment of the PTO requires
   properly assessing the RTT, which is requires a full RTT.

   If the Initial Idle Timeout, Initial RTT and Initial PTO are set
   values too small, the connection attempt will be interrupted by the
   Idle Timeout and will fail.

4.  Flow control and congestion control

   QUIC congestion control and flow control processes both control how
   fast an endpoint can send, either using local measurements of network
   capacity in the case of congestion control, or abiding to
   transmission limits set by the peer in the case of congestion
   control.

   In both cases, if the transmission limits are smaller than the
   "bandwidth delay product" (BDP), transmission will throttled.
   Because of long delays, the BDP required for spatial communications
   can be quite large, as we discuss in the next sections.

4.1.  Flow Control

4.2.  Congestion control and Slow Start

5.  Packet losses

   Packet losses will likely occur in space communications like in other
   media.  The loss recovery mechanisms spedified in [QUIC-RECOVERY]
   correct losses after at best one RTT, with repeated losses requiring
   further RTT sized delays.  In space communications, the long delays
   for packet loss recovery will affect the responsiveness of the
   application.  In some cases, the loss recovery delays may extend the
   duration of the transfer past the time of availability of the
   transmission links.

5.1.  Packet Losses During Handshake

6.  Implementation Guidance

   TODO: pay attention to delays.

6.1.  Setting the initial RTT

6.2.  Setting the initial BDP

   (Cite existing work for geo satellites)

6.3.  Using Forward Error Correction

   (Consider ananlogy with requirements for Media over QUIC)

7.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
