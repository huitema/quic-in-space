   over deep space links, where delays are in order of minutes and
   communications are based on scheduled time windows.  Using the
   experience of various testbeds, it provides guidance to
   implementations to support this use case.  This document may apply to
   other use cases that have similar characteristics, such as IoT in
   disconnected and distant settings.

1.  Introduction

   QUIC is a new transport bringing very interesting features that could
   enable its use in space, where TCP is not good, as assessed in
   [DTN-ARCH].  However, QUIC was designed for terrestrial Internet,
   which brings assumptions on typical delays and connectivity.  In
   (deep) space, delays are much larger, in order of minutes (4-20
   minutes from Earth to Mars), and long disruptions, such as because of
   orbital dynamics, in order of minutes or hours or days.

   It may be possible to modify the base behavior of QUIC stacks to
   satisfy these requirements.  For example, several assumptions, such
   as the initial round-trip time(RTT), are just static constants in the
   implementations that could be externalized so they could better start
   the QUIC machinery in the context of space.

   The purpose of this document is to provide guidance for supporting
   space communications in QUIC implementations.  It should be noted
   that it may also apply to other use cases that have similar
   characteristics, such as IoT in disconnected and far away settings,
   but these are not considered specifically in this document.

   Various other considerations such as how to store packets during
   disruptions or network management considerations are out of scope of
   this document.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Timer Constants in QUIC

   QUIC implementations typically use a number of time related
   variables, with different characteristics.  Some may be constants
   suggested by the QUIC specification or chosen by the stack
   developers, some may be negotiated between peers, and some may be
   discovered as part of running the protocol.  Preliminary tests showed
   that setting the constant values appropriately seemed to make QUIC
   usable in those deep space scenarios.  Therefore, this document
   discusses them in the following sections.

3.1.  Probe Timeout and Initial RTT (#initial-rtt)

   As defined in [QUIC-RECOVERY], QUIC uses two mechanisms to detect
   packet losses.  The acknowledgement based method detect losses if a
   packet is not yet acknowledged while packets sent later have already
   been.  That method works well even if the transmission delay is long,
   but cannot detect the loss of the "last packet".  For that, QUIC uses
   the probe timeout(PTO) defined in Section 6.2 of [QUIC-RECOVERY].  If
   the last packet is not yet acknowledged after the probe timeout, the
   endpoint sends a "probe" to trigger an acknwledgement.  The probe
   timer is initially set as a function of the measured RTT and RTTVAR.
   It is then increased exponentially as the number of unacknowledged
   repetitions increases.

   The mechanism works well if the transmission delay is long after the
   RTT has been evaluated at least once.  But before that, the probe
   timeout is set as a function of the Initial RTT, whose recommended
   value is 333 milliseconds per Section 6.2.2 of [QUIC-RECOVERY].  Many
   implementations use smaller values because waiting too long results
   in longer connection delays when losses occur.  The recommended
   initial value of 333ms results in a PTO of 1 second, but the shorter
   values used by some implementations can result in a PTO of 200 or
   250ms.  On a long delay link, we will probably see the following:

   1.  Initial transmission

   2.  First repeat after timer (e.g. 1 second)

   3.  2nd repeat after timer (e.g., 1 second again), after which the
       timer is doubled

   4.  3rd repeat after the increased (e.g., 2 seconds), after which the
       timer is doubled again

   5.  etc.

   If we let the process go long enough, a succession of doubling will
   probably match the required value, probably after a dozen repeats if
   the delay is about 20 minutes.  In that case, one of the dozen
   repeats will most likely be successful, but of course a lot of extra
   energy will have been expanded.  But the connection establishment
   will fail if the process is interrupted too soon, either because the
   maximum number of repeats has been reached, or because the "idle
   timeout" has been exceeded.

3.2.  Idle Timeout

   The idle timeout is defined in Section 10.1 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].
   Each peer proposes a "max_idle_timeout" value, and commits to close
   the connection if no activity happens during that timeout.  The
   "max_idle_timeout" value is often set as a constant by either the
   stack or the application using it, with typical values ranging from a
   few seconds to a few minutes.

   The specification anticipated the usage of long delay links somewhat,
   and states that "To avoid excessively small idle timeout periods,
   endpoints MUST increase the idle timeout period to be at least three
   times the current Probe Timeout (PTO)."  This will prevent
   interference between the idle timeout once the PTO has been properly
   assessed.  However, this proper assessment of the PTO requires
   properly assessing the RTT, which is requires a full RTT.

   If the Initial Idle Timeout, Initial RTT and Initial PTO are set
   values too small, the connection attempt will be interrupted by the
   Idle Timeout and will fail.

   Since the idle timeout is negotiated as the minimum of the values
   proposed by the two endpoints, both peers should proposed values that
   allow for a successful handshake.

4.  Flow Control

   Flow control in QUIC allows an endpoint to limit how many bytes the
   peer can send on the opened streams, on specific streams, and how
   many streams the peer can open.  Different stacks follow different
   strategies, balancing two risks:

   *  if the flow control is too loose, the peer could send data faster
      than the local application can process and create a form of local
      congestion.

   *  if the flow control is too restrictive, the peer will be blocked
      and will have to wait for the next flow control update before
      sending data or opening streams.

   The peer will not be blocked if three conditions are met:

   *  the "max streams" credits allow for a number of stream at least as
      large as expected to be open in an RTT.

   *  the global flow control (MAX DATA) allows transmission of a full
      bandwidth-delay product (BDP) worth of data,

   *  for each stream, the stream flow control allows transmission of
      either a full BDP worth of data, or the full size of the data
      stream.

   Setting these three limits correctly requires anticipating the RTT
   and bandwidth of the connection.  Implementations relying on adaptive
   algorithms are at risk here, especially if they use a low default
   value until RTT and bandwidth have been measured.

5.  Congestion control and Slow Start

   QUIC implementations use congestion control to ensure that they are
   not sending data faster than the network path can forward, which
   would cause network queues and packet drops.  Congestion control will
   typically set a congestion window size (CWIN) to limit the amount of
   bytes in transit.  Transmission will be slowed down CWIN is lower
   than the BDP.

   The main congestion control issues for long delay space connections
   are observed at the beginning of the connection.  The congestion
   control algorithms typically start with conservative values of CWIN,
   which they ramp up progressively, typically not faster than one
   doubling per RTT.  On a long delay space connection, this ramping up
   will take a very long time, leading to very inefficient use of the
   connection.

   Implementations have tried to palliate this issue in many ways:

   *  measure the transmission speed of short trains of packets to
      rapidly estimate the bandwidth of the connection,

   *  remember the delays and bandwidths of past connections and set the
      initial parameters of new connections accordingly,

   *  obtain estimates of delays and bandwidth through network
      management interfaces and use them to set appropriate parameters.

   If initial parameters are set correctly, connections can still be
   unnecessarily throttled if they fail to adapt to changing conditions.
   For example, after the initial "slow start", the classic RENO
   algorithm moves to a "congestion avoidance" phase in which the CWIN
   increases by at most one packet per RTT -- which would be completely
   inadequate with RTTs of several minutes.

5.1.  Setting the initial BDP

   The congestion control issues are not specific to the very long
   delays of space communications.  They are visible on paths through
   geostationary satellites.  The recommended approach is to somehow
   remember path characteristics from previous connections, then use the
   remembered values to speed up the start-up phase of congestion
   control.

   The "careful resume" draft suggest a cautious approach of only using
   the remembered BDP values after the RTT has been verified, see
   [I-D.tsvwg-careful-resume].  This verification takes one RTT, which
   is a tradeoff between the desire to ramp up transmission rate
   promptly and the risk of causing congestion on the transmission path
   if the remembered value exceeds the current path characteristics.

   If the BDP is remembered and set, the value can also be used to set
   flow control parameters as mentioned in Section 4.

6.  Packet losses

   Packet losses will likely occur in space communications like in other
   media.  The loss recovery mechanisms spedified in [QUIC-RECOVERY]
   correct losses after at best one RTT, with repeated losses requiring
   further RTT sized delays.  In space communications, the long delays
   for packet loss recovery will affect the responsiveness of the
   application.  In some cases, the loss recovery delays may extend the
   duration of the transfer past the time of availability of the
   transmission links.

6.1.  Packet Losses During Handshake

   Packet losses during the initial handshake may prevent the endpoints
   from obtaining a proper estimate of the RTT.  An implementation in
   these situations can either repeat the packets "too soon" if it
   underestimates the RTT, or "too late" if it sets a large value.
   Experience showed that of those pitfalls, "too soon" is much better,
   because it simply leads to repeating too many copies of the handshake
   packets.  This may look wasteful, but it does ensure that the
   handshake completes rapidly even if some packets are actually lost.

6.2.  Reordering Buffers

   If packets carrying stream data are lost, the other packets received
   on that stream are supposed to be buffered until the packet loss is
   corrected.  Receivers have to be ready to buffer a full BDP worth of
   data.  This means not only having large amount of receive buffers,
   but also make sure that reordering of data is done efficiently,
   risking otherwise some significant performance bottlenecks.

   Reordering will also interfere with per-stream and per-connection
   flow control.  In Section 4, we wrote that the amount of credits
   should be at least one full BDP.  But if we assume that a full BDP
   worth of buffers can be consumed by reordering after losses, then the
   required credits are actually two BDPs, not just one.

6.3.  Using Forward Error Correction

   The effect of packet losses could be alleviated by using some form of
   Forward Error Correction.  This is an active research issue, see for
   example [I-D.michel-quic-fec]

7.  Further studies

   There are other considerations related to using QUIC in space,
   related to naming, security, or the management of multiple paths.

   Most QUIC stack can set connections towards specified IP addresses,
   but most existing QUIC applications rely on the DNS to find the IP
   addresses associated to names of servers.  Using DNS in space
   probably poses its own set of challenges, which deserve their own
   study.

   Per [QUIC-TLS], QUIC embeds TLS 1.3 and relies on it to negotiate
   security keys.  This document discusses the effects of long delays on
   the initial handshake, which embeds the TLS 1.3 handshake.  There are
   secondary effects that ought to be discussed, such as the handling of
   certificate verification and possibly certificate revocations, or the
   extra roundtrip required for performing client authorization.

   It is probably possible to use multiple path to increase the
   throughput or reliability of transmissions.  Operating multiple path
   with long delays ought to be discussed in a future version of this
   document.

8.  Security Considerations

   The solutions envisaged here to alleviate the effect of long delays
   on QUIC connections may well create some form of security issues.
   These ought to be discussed in a future version of this document.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
